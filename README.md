## About Me

I am a software engineer passionate about knowledge and communication. Like the philosopher Ren√© Descartes, I believe that:

‚ú® "I would give everything I know, for half of what I ignore."

I have always enjoyed sports, nature, and people. I believe that truth is always the best path.

My passion for learning and teaching, combined with my restlessness to seek more knowledge about everything, has made me a generalist. In a multidisciplinary world, constantly changing, with a huge volume of new information emerging every moment, being able to move between different areas and help link them is perhaps my biggest differential. This allows me to connect people and concepts, with a broad vision, contributing to greater synergy.
