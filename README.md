# Hi, I’m Lincoln!

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about knowledge and communication. Like the philosopher René Descartes, 

  > ✨ "I would give everything I know, <br>
  > for half of what I ignore". 

I like and always liked sports, nature, and people. I believe the truth is always the best way.

My passion for learning and teaching, and my restlessness to seek to know more about everything, made me a generalist.

In a multidisciplinary world, in constant change, with a huge volume of new information emerging at every moment, to be able to move between different areas and help to link them is perhaps my biggest differential. It allows me to connect people and concepts, with a broad vision, contributing to greater synergy.

- 👀 I’m interested in software architecture, education, and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GO lang and functional programming.
