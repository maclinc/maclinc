I'm a software engineer who is passionate about knowledge and communication. Like the philosopher René Descartes, "I would give everything I know, for half of what I ignore". 

I like and always liked sports, nature, and people. I believe the truth is always the best way.

Teaching in technology college courses reinforced my technical training and at the same time awakened in me the pleasure of communication and the transmission of knowledge. Being part of other people's growth is fantastic! 

As a developer analyst, responsible for two key systems related to production planning and control, I’ve learned the importance of solid results. The industry often prioritizes time and cost whereas school usually puts quality above everything else. That experience made me a professional with a broader and more pragmatic vision.

At Borland, the manufacturer of compilers for the most studied programming languages during my graduation, I had contact with technology authorities as well as large customers.

My passion for learning and teaching, and my restlessness to seek to know more about everything, made me a generalist.

In a multidisciplinary world, in constant change, with a huge volume of new information emerging at every moment, to be able to move between different areas and help to connect them is perhaps my biggest differential, as it allows me to connect people and ideas from different areas, with a broad vision, contributing to greater synergy.

Looking forward, I feel that all ways are open and there is much more to learn and to share.
