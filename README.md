I'm a software engineer who is passionate about knowledge and communication. Like the philosopher Ren√© Descartes, 

> "I would give everything I know, for half of what I ignore". 

I like and always liked sports, nature, and people. I believe the truth is always the best way.

My passion for learning and teaching, and my restlessness to seek to know more about everything, made me a generalist.

In a multidisciplinary world, in constant change, with a huge volume of new information emerging at every moment, to be able to move between different areas and help to connect them is perhaps my biggest differential, as it allows me to connect people and ideas from different areas, with a broad vision, contributing to greater synergy.

Looking forward, I feel that all ways are open and there is much more to learn and to share.
